Welcome to Seraphim Foundation; Underground Bunker Warfare Simulation

This is a game im working on with really basic graphics, probably wont use any sprites, and try to draw stuff directly onto the screen as much as possible.

The game concept is really simple;

You have robots to control via an command line, and you will gather resources and fight your way through a series of bunkers to progress.
The underground bunker warfare theme came from me just looking up random shit about future of the warfare, and finding out that it my be fought entirely in bunkers due to surface being irradiated.


# Lore:
The story takes place in an already existing worldbuilding project of mine named Seraphim Foundation (duh), and this game takes place in Timeline A where an event called "Kyrios Civil War" occurs.
You are part of the army that is technologically superior, but inferior in manpower, Seraphim Empire, and its Imperial Army.
You are fighting in the so called "DeMilitarized Zone aka DMZ", which is by no means demilitarized, its only a name put to satisfy the public.
You have been sent a month or two after the bombing of the DMZ by an unknown organization (Kyrios Kingdom blames the Empire but Empire denies responsibility) with an Cursed Bomb.
This causes the creation of "Scorched Sea" which leads to the surface being occupied by many mutants and anomalies alike, so both sides started digging tunnels to try to establish a military presense.
Your job is to clear out the Royal Army underground bunkers, but due to supply lines not being feasable at the moment, you will have to collect your own supplies.
Good luck.
